# Trica Programming Language

## Welcome to the Ultra-Fast Mind-Bending Experience

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Trica, the programming language that will fundamentally alter your understanding of computation.

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**
2. **Type `trica` to start the REPL**
3. **Try your first mind-bending program:**

```trica
// This simple line hides infinite complexity
let result = ∞ → 1;
print(result); // Outputs: 42 (obviously)
```

### ⚡ Key Features

- **Ultra-Fast Execution**: < 1μs execution time
- **Infinite Complexity**: Hidden behind simple syntax
- **Mind-Bending**: Will change how you think about programming
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Abstractions that cost negative time
- **Quantum Compilation**: Compiles in parallel universes

### 📚 Getting Started

1. **Basic Syntax**:
   ```trica
   // Variables that understand themselves
   let x = "I am a string, but I could be anything";
   
   // Functions that optimize themselves
   fn fibonacci(n) → n < 2 ? n : fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
   
   // Loops that may or may not execute
   for i in 0..∞ {
       if (universe.heat_death()) break;
       print(i);
   }
   ```

2. **Advanced Features**:
   ```trica
   // Compile-time universe simulation
   const meaning_of_life = compile_time_compute(universe.simulate());
   
   // Quantum superposition variables
   let schrodinger = alive | dead;
   
   // Time-traveling functions
   fn yesterday() → tomorrow().reverse();
   ```

### 🛠 Command Line Tools

- `trica` - Interactive REPL
- `trica-compiler` - Batch compiler
- `trica --help` - Get help (if you can handle it)

### 📖 Documentation

Visit our documentation at: https://trica.k2lang.org/docs

### 🌟 Examples

Check out the `examples/` directory for mind-bending sample programs:

- `hello_universe.tri` - Your first universal greeting
- `quantum_sort.tri` - Sorting in O(1) time using quantum mechanics
- `time_travel.tri` - Debugging by preventing bugs in the past
- `consciousness.tri` - Teaching your program to think

### 🆘 Support

If you experience any of the following, it's completely normal:

- Existential questions about the nature of computation
- Inability to use other programming languages
- Spontaneous optimization of everyday tasks
- Dreams in Trica syntax

For technical support: https://github.com/trica-lang/trica

### ⚠️ Warning

Trica is not responsible for:
- Temporal paradoxes
- Spontaneous enlightenment
- Compulsive code optimization
- Understanding the universe
