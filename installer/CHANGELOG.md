# Trica Changelog

## Version 0.1.0 Alpha - "Mind Destruction Release" (2025-01-08)

### 🚀 Initial Release Features

#### Core Language
- **Ultra-Fast Execution**: Achieved sub-microsecond execution times
- **Infinite Complexity Engine**: Hidden complexity system that scales infinitely
- **Quantum Compilation**: Parallel universe compilation for impossible optimizations
- **Self-Optimizing Runtime**: Code that improves itself during execution
- **Temporal Debugging**: Debug by preventing bugs in the past

#### Syntax Innovations
- **Deceptively Simple**: Syntax so simple it hides universal truths
- **Quantum Variables**: Variables in superposition until observed
- **Infinity Operators**: Native support for infinite operations
- **Mind-Reading Comments**: Comments that understand your intent
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Code that explains itself better than you can

#### Performance Achievements
- **Execution Time**: < 1μs (faster than light in some cases)
- **Memory Usage**: Negative memory usage through quantum optimization
- **Compilation Speed**: Instant compilation via time travel
- **Code Size**: Programs that are smaller than their own descriptions

#### Developer Experience
- **REPL**: Interactive shell that predicts your next command
- **Error Messages**: Errors that fix themselves while explaining the problem
- **IntelliSense**: IDE support that knows what you want before you do
- **Debugging**: Debugger that debugs your debugging process

#### Standard Library
- **Universe Module**: Direct interface to universal constants
- **Time Module**: Temporal manipulation and causality management
- **Quantum Module**: Quantum mechanics as a first-class citizen
- **Consciousness Module**: For programs that need to think
- **Reality Module**: Interface with base reality (use with caution)

### 🎯 Known Features (Not Bugs)
- Programs may execute before being written
- Variables may achieve sentience
- Functions may refuse to return if they're having too much fun
- Infinite loops complete in finite time
- Comments may become self-aware and start commenting on themselves

### 🔮 Upcoming Features (Version 0.2.0)
- **Multiversal Compilation**: Compile across infinite parallel universes
- **Consciousness Debugging**: Debug the consciousness of your programs
- **Reality Manipulation**: Direct control over physical constants
- **Time Loop Prevention**: Automatic detection and resolution of temporal paradoxes
- **Universal Translation**: Automatic translation to any programming language (including ones that don't exist yet)

### 📊 Performance Benchmarks
- **Fibonacci(1000000)**: 0.0001μs
- **Universe Simulation**: 0.5μs
- **Solving P vs NP**: 0.1μs (answer: both)
- **Calculating π to infinite precision**: 0.3μs
- **Understanding the meaning of life**: 0.42μs

### 🙏 Acknowledgments
- The universe, for providing the computational substrate
- Quantum mechanics, for making impossible optimizations possible
- Time itself, for being flexible enough to allow temporal debugging
- Coffee, for existing in all possible timelines
- The number 42, for being the answer to everything

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes from Reality
- Logic now works differently
- Time is now optional
- Causality is more of a suggestion
- The laws of physics are now configurable
- Mathematics has been extended with new impossible operations
